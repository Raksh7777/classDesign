# classDesign

Design a class call DeckOfCards to represent an actual deck of cards. This class should contain 52 cards eg-> 6h, Jh, Js where the first capital letter represents the rank and the second the suit The class should expose only two methods which the client can access. The deal and the shuffle method. The deal method returns a card and the shuffle method methods shuffles the deck(use appropriate algo for shuffling) Write unit test for both these methods. Finally write a program that simulates a game between 2 players (A and B). The game consists of 5 rounds. Each round the deck is shuffled, both of the players get dealt 3 cards each. The player with the highest sum of values wins the round. Best of 5 rounds. The program should end by printing the winner. The program is the client and the methods on the DeckOfCards is api it uses. Handle all edge cases. The client should not be able to alter the state of the deck of cards in any way.
